            Seriously, this hurts my eyes.<br />

            How do I get something a small distance away from the side of the screen? like an indent.<br />
            <dir = rtl>
                I feel like this shouldn't work.<br />
                Why does <code>&lt;dir = rtl&gt; &lt;/dir&gt;</code> only push the text over a little bit?
            </dir>
        </p>
        <p align = right>
            This is too far to the right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Could I change the alignment without starting a new paragraph?<br />
            What if I want a new paragraph without a gap in between it and the previous paragraph?
        </p>
